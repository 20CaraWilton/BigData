For this project, we were tasked to analyze and use big data about a topic we were interested in. Then, we created a website and were tasked to use the big data to promote change within a company of our choice.


In light of recent events, my group and I decided to put our focus on Mass Shootings and Gun Control. The recent mass shootings have caused debate over gun control. Our goal is to provide information, over gun control amd mass shootings, to insure that individuals on both sides of this political debate are educated over the topic. 

Our teams research question consisted of the following-
What is the correlation between mass shootings and gun control?

Where in the world are these topics searched? 
What region has the most interest in these topics?
